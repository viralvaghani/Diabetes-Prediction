# Diabetes-Prediction


Diabetes Prediction Tool

**Aim:**
The aim of this project is to process the data using pyspark and develop Diabetes Prediction Tool

**Input**
  
  rel.csv

In this dataset, each line is a pair of strings separated with comma, where each line represents certain relations between two biomedical concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Formally, each line can be represented as a concept pair (c1, c2)

  diabetes.csv

This dataset will be used for diabetes prediction. It consists of 9 variables (or features), where the first 8 variables are predictor (independent) variables, and the last variable “Outcome” is the target (dependent) variable we are going to predict (1 means the patient is diabetic, and 0 means not). Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on


**Output:**
Develop machine learning models that predict the diabetes
